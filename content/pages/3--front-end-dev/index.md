[Life in code with Lucas](https://life-in-code.lucasmcdaniel.com) is a blog I have just launched.

It will be a home for all instruction and tutorial articles relating to new dev elements I learn. The dominant subject areas will be of course React, Python, HTML5, CSS3, Vue.js, music, philosophy, gaming, and parenting.

If you want to be informed about new content on the blog follow me on Twitter - [@ldmcdaniel109](https://twitter.com/ldmcdaniel109).

Are you thinking about a particular subject, relating to the starters, I could write about? Tweet me.
